# FinalProject (CS5005 / OOD)

This repo folder contains the recitation deliverable for the Final Project kickoff.

## Contents
- `recitation_submission.txt` — single text file that includes teammate(s), elevator pitch, and a rough domain object list / sketch.
- `elevator_pitch.txt` — standalone elevator pitch (same text as in the submission file).
- `domain_objects.md` — slightly richer breakdown of anticipated classes and relationships.

## Scope
Keep features minimal per course guidance. Focus on clean OOD (interfaces, encapsulation, MVC seams) and unit tests. In‑memory only (no DB/network).

## Submit
Push this `FinalProject/` folder to GitHub and submit the folder URL on Canvas.
